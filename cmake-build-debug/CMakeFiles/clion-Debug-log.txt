CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindD:/Programming/Libraries/SFML/include/.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "D:/Programming/Libraries/SFML/include/",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "D:/Programming/Libraries/SFML/include/" with any of the following names:

    D:/Programming/Libraries/SFML/include/Config.cmake
    d:/programming/libraries/sfml/include/-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "D:/Programming/Libraries/SFML/include/" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "D:/Programming/Libraries/SFML/include/_DIR" to a
  directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "D:/Programming/Libraries/SFML/include/" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
