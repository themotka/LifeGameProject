CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindC:/SFML-2.5.1/include/.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "C:/SFML-2.5.1/include/", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "C:/SFML-2.5.1/include/" with any of the following names:

    C:/SFML-2.5.1/include/Config.cmake
    c:/sfml-2.5.1/include/-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "C:/SFML-2.5.1/include/" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "C:/SFML-2.5.1/include/_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "C:/SFML-2.5.1/include/" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
